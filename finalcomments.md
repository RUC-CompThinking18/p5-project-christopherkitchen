# Interactivity
I liked the variation on a color picker that can store different variables and give you the ability to create a full palette from an image. It might have been nice (and this is fairly advanced) for you to give the user the ability to export their colors (in a text file even) for use later.

# Code Quality
This was really interesting in that it made very little use of the draw function and instead focused on your own functions. And, of course, I'm always happy to see someone "thinking in functions" since it's one of the hardest gaps to jump in programming. I would have liked to see more comments explaining those functions.

# Aesthetics
This is a great little project. A weekend of solid effort could turn this into a one-page site where users could upload their own images and pull color palettes from it.
